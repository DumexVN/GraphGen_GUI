Graph GUI
Allow visualisation and interaction with graphs.
Core features involve interaction with graphs with clustering objectives i.e.
- generate various graph models Gnp, Configuration Model, etc.
- visualise/layout using some force-directed algorithms
- some algorithms for clustering i.e. mean-shift, k-means, ran-agg
- clustering quality: modularity, fraction of correctly classified, etc.

Written C++ on windows, requires Qt5, boost, BGL library. 
Interfrace designed using QtDesign.
